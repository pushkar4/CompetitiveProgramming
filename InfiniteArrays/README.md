Infinite arrays 
You ere gven an array A of size N. You have also defined an array B as the concatenation of array A for infinite number of times. 
example, if A = {A1,A2,A3}, then B = {A1,A2,A3,A1,A2,A3,A1,A2,A3,...}
Nuv, you ere given Q queries. Each query consists of two integers, end Your task is to calculate the sum of the subarray of N from index Li to Ri. 
Note As the value of this output is very large, print the answer es modulus log + 7. 
Input format 
First line: T denoting the number of test cases 
For each test case: 
o First line: Contains N, the size of the array 
o Second line: Contains N space-separated integers corresponding .44 
o Third line: Contains Q denoting number of queries 
o Zurth line: Contains Q space-separated integers corresponding to Li 
o Fifth line: Contains Q space-separated integers corresponding to 
Output format 
each test case, print Q space-separated integers thet denote the answers of the provided Q queries. Print the answer each test case in line.
