Minimum Swaps 
Swapnil has an matrix of integers and wants to find the minimum number of swaps required to bring the largest element to 
the center of the matrix. Swaps can be made with horizontally and vertically adjacent elements only. 
For a matrix m x n , where m is the number of rows and n the number of columns. For even values of both m and n , there 
are 4 centers. 
He can do it with small matrices but for large ones, he's lost. Help him solve this problem. 
Input Format 
The first line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers 
separated bg space m and n denoting the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix respectively. The 
following m lines describe the matrix. Each line consists of n integers, each i 
Output Format 
For each test case, output the minimum number of swaps required. If there are several largest integers, output the 
minimum required to get ang one of them to ang one of the center positions.
