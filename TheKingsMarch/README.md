reach the top left square marked with e The rest of the squares are labeled either with a number (marking a point) or with x marking 
an obstacle. Note that the king can move up, left and up-left (diagonal) only. Find the maximum points the king can collect and the number 
of such paths the king can take in order to do so 
Input Format 
The first line of input consists of an integer t _ This is the number of test cases. Each test case contains a number n which denotes the size 
of board. This is followed bg n lines each containing n space separated integers. 
Output Format 
For each case, print in a separate line the maximum points that can be collected and the number of paths available in order to ensure 
maximum, both values separated bg a space. If e is unreachable from s , print e e.
