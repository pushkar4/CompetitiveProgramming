Minimum Swaps 
Swapnil has an array of integers and wants to find the minimum number of swaps required to bring the largest element to 
the middle of the arrag_ 
Note that if n is odd, where n is the number of elements in the array, the middle is the (n + 1) / 2 position (indexing begins 
from 1); if n is even, then there are two numbers in the middle (the (n / 2) position and ((n / 2) + 1) positions) 
He can do it with arrays of a small number of elements but for large ones, he's lost Help him solve this problem. 
Constraints 
1. o T 5000 
2. O N 1000 
Input Format 
The first line contains an integer T indicating the number of test cases 
The first line of each test case contains an integer N 
The second Line contains N space separated integers 
Output Format 
Output the minimum number of swaps required to get the largest integer to the middle where middle is defined as above. If 
there are several largest integers, output the minimum required to get ang one of them to the middle position.
