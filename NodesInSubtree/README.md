Nodes in a subtree 
You ere gven a rooted tree that contains N nodes Each node contains a luverczse 
You ere required to answer Q queries of type u, C, where u is an integer and C is a luverczse alphabet. The count of nodes in the subtree of the node u containing C is considered as the answer of all the 
queries. 
Input format 
First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q respecttvety 
Second line: A string S of length N (where the i"' character of S represents the character stored in node i) 
Next N — I line Two space-separated integers and u denoting an edge between node and node u 
Next Q lines: An integer u and space-separated character c 
Output format 
each query, print the output in new line. 
Constraints 
• c is a luverczse 
S' is lowercase alphabet for all I S i N 
I is the root node 
Note It is guaranteed that the input generates a valid tree
